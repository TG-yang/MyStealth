# MyStealth
after reading some Unity3D game development booksï¼Œ I used some skills which are learnt from those books, like changing camera position more smoothly to develop this game
In this game, in order to change the main camera in the right position, I use interpolating function in changing camera's position.
Moreover, I use sent a ray from main camera, which can judge whether the player in the camera and if not, the system move the camera automatically depending on interpolating function.
In some situations, the player may be not in the camera,like the player standing behind the wall.
This skill can not only help you move camera more naturally, but also make sure the player in the camera.
